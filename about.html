                    <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p >The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in
                1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn
                and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago
                northside neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer
                time of parents and previous league members.</p>
